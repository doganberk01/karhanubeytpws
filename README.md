## 📝 Notes

* Make sure to have all the project files in the same directory to avoid broken links.  
* This project uses **static HTML pages**, so opening `index.html` directly in the browser should work for local viewing.  
* For more advanced development or if you plan to integrate dynamic features, consider running a local server (e.g., VS Code Live Server, Python HTTP server).  
* Keep `css/`, `js/`, and `html/` folders organized to ensure the website functions correctly.  
* All personal information (social media links) can be updated in the relevant HTML files.
